## Overview

As an Industry Lab Participant, I collaborated with senior cloud engineers to:

- Validate cloud-native traits including autoscaling, resiliency, and least privilege.
- Conduct manual and simulated tests on the VPN service using a CLI Python tool.
- Evaluate IAM configurations and test user privilege enforcement.
- Review pod behavior and autoscaling recovery mechanisms.
- Provide remediation recommendations focused on container isolation, IAM hardening, and firewall policy structuring.

## Key Learning Outcomes

- Practical experience assessing a cloud-native application under simulated production conditions.
- Exposure to enterprise-grade VPN design, deployment, and scaling mechanisms.
- Hands-on testing of application reliability, user isolation, and privilege separation strategies.

## Skills Applied

- Cloud Infrastructure Testing
- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Network/Application Security
- Python CLI Automation
- Cloud-native Design Patterns (Redundancy, Resiliency, Least Privilege)
